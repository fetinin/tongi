# Known Test Issues

## Overview
After implementing fixes for 9 failing tests, 7 tests remain failing. These issues are documented below for future resolution.

## Issue 1: Transaction Query Returns Empty for Reward Transactions

### Affected Tests (6 tests)
- `transaction-flow.test.ts`: "should complete full transaction confirmation flow for reward"
- `transaction-flow.test.ts`: "should complete full transaction confirmation flow for purchase"
- `transaction-flow.test.ts`: "should handle transaction confirmation with empty TON hash"
- `transaction-flow.test.ts`: "should prevent unauthorized transaction confirmation"
- `transaction-flow.test.ts`: "should handle pagination correctly in transaction history"
- `transaction-flow.test.ts`: "should filter transactions by type"

### Root Cause
The `getUserTransactions()` query in `TransactionService.ts` (lines 165-172) uses LEFT JOINs:

```sql
SELECT t.* FROM transactions t
LEFT JOIN users u1 ON t.from_wallet = u1.ton_wallet_address
LEFT JOIN users u2 ON t.to_wallet = u2.ton_wallet_address
WHERE u1.id = ? OR u2.id = ?
```

**The Problem:**
- Reward transactions have `from_wallet` = bank wallet address (`UQBankWallet123456789_0123456789ABCDEFabcdef-_XY`)
- Bank wallet address doesn't belong to any user in the `users` table
- Therefore, `u1.id` is NULL for reward transactions
- SQL WHERE clause: `NULL = userId OR u2.id = userId`
- In SQL, `NULL = anything` evaluates to NULL (not true), so the first condition fails
- While `u2.id = userId` should match, it seems the query still returns empty

### Potential Solutions

**Option 1: Handle NULL in WHERE clause**
```sql
WHERE (u1.id = ? OR u1.id IS NULL) OR u2.id = ?
```

**Option 2: Special-case bank wallet**
```sql
WHERE u1.id = ? OR u2.id = ? OR t.from_wallet = (SELECT wallet_address FROM bank_wallet WHERE id = 1)
```

**Option 3: Create bank wallet as a user**
- Add bank wallet to the `users` table with a special ID (e.g., 0)
- This would make all joins work naturally

### Test Evidence
```
Expected value: ObjectContaining {"amount": 10, "id": 216, "status": "pending", "transactionType": "reward"}
Received array: []
```

Transaction ID 216 exists (created successfully), but query returns empty array.

## Issue 2: Marketplace Concurrent Purchase Test Pattern Matching

### Affected Test (1 test)
- `marketplace-flow.test.ts`: "should handle concurrent purchase attempts"

### Error Message
```
expect(received).toMatch(expected)

Expected pattern: /not available|already purchased/i
Received string:  "Wish has already been purchased"
```

### Analysis
The error message "Wish has already been purchased" **DOES** match the pattern `/not available|already purchased/i` (it contains "already purchased").

### Potential Causes

**Option 1: Response body already consumed**
- The test reads response bodies in a loop (line 462-466)
- One of the responses may have already been consumed before calling `.json()`
- Need to check if responses are being cloned or consumed multiple times

**Option 2: Async timing issue**
- The test uses `Promise.all()` for concurrent requests
- Response body reading happens in a loop after Promise.all resolves
- There might be a timing issue with when bodies can be read

### Test Code (lines 460-467)
```typescript
// Failed response should indicate wish is no longer available
for (const failedResponse of failed) {
  if (failedResponse.status === 400) {
    const errorData = await failedResponse.json();
    expect(errorData.message).toMatch(/not available|already.*purchased/i);
  }
}
```

### Fix Attempt Already Made
The pattern was updated from `/not available|already purchased/i` to `/not available|already.*purchased/i` (with `.*` between "already" and "purchased"), but the test still fails.

### Recommended Investigation
1. Add logging before `.json()` call to confirm response hasn't been consumed
2. Check if response needs to be cloned for multiple reads
3. Verify that `failedResponse.status === 400` is actually true for the failing case

## Summary

- **7 total failing tests** (down from 9 originally)
- **6 tests** fail due to transaction query issue (bank wallet not matching users)
- **1 test** fails due to apparent pattern matching issue (likely response consumption)

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix transaction query to handle bank wallet properly
   - This will resolve 6 tests at once
   - Recommend Option 1 or Option 3 from solutions above

2. **Priority 2**: Debug marketplace concurrent purchase test
   - Add logging to understand why pattern match fails
   - May need to clone responses or restructure test

## Files Modified During Fix Attempts

- `tests/integration/transaction-flow.test.ts` - Bank wallet address length fixed (46 â†’ 48 chars)
- `src/services/CorgiService.ts` - Added `CorgiAuthorizationError` class
- `src/services/TransactionService.ts` - Added wish status rollback on failed transactions, changed JOIN to LEFT JOIN
- `src/services/WishService.ts` - Fixed TOCTOU race condition in `purchaseWish()`
- `tests/integration/marketplace-flow.test.ts` - Updated regex pattern
- `src/app/api/transactions/[id]/confirm/route.ts` - Updated validation message
