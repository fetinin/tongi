# Specification Quality Checklist: TON Wallet Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed validation:

### Content Quality Review
- Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Written in plain language for business stakeholders
- No specific technology implementation details in requirements
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can connect in under 30 seconds" not "API responds in 200ms")
- 15+ acceptance scenarios cover all primary flows
- 10 edge cases identified
- Scope clearly separates in-scope vs out-of-scope items
- 9 assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness Review
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) with independent test criteria
- All success criteria can be measured without knowing implementation
- Spec contains no leaked implementation details (database schemas, API endpoints, component names)

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for the next phase: `/speckit.plan`
