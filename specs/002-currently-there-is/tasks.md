# Tasks: Buddy Request Accept/Reject Actions

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-currently-there-is/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the spec - test tasks are included for completeness but can be deferred or skipped for MVP.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify project structure and dependencies (no new setup required)

- [X] T001 Verify development environment: `pnpm install` and `pnpm run type-check` pass
- [X] T002 Confirm existing BuddyService and NotificationService are functional

**Status**: ‚úÖ No setup needed - project infrastructure already exists

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core service layer methods that MUST be complete before ANY user story UI/API can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No API route or UI work can begin until this phase is complete

### Service Layer Foundation

- [X] T003 [P] [Foundation] Add `rejectBuddyRequest()` method to `src/services/BuddyService.ts` (mirrors confirmBuddyRequest pattern, sets status to 'dissolved', validates recipient)
- [X] T004 [P] [Foundation] Add `notifyBuddyRejected()` method to `src/services/NotificationService.ts` (sends "‚ùå Buddy request: {rejecterName} declined your buddy request.")

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - service layer can accept and reject buddy requests. User story implementation can now begin in parallel.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Accept Incoming Buddy Request (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users who receive buddy requests to accept them, establishing an active buddy partnership.

**Independent Test**: Create a pending buddy request in the database (user A ‚Üí user B), log in as user B, navigate to buddy status screen, tap "Accept", verify status changes to "active" and user A receives notification.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Create API route `src/app/api/buddy/accept/route.ts` (POST endpoint, validates Telegram initData, calls buddyService.confirmBuddyRequest, returns BuddyPairWithProfile)
- [X] T006 [P] [US1] Add state management to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (useState for isProcessing and actionError)
- [X] T007 [US1] Add `handleAccept()` function to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (calls /api/buddy/accept, sets processing state, refreshes buddy status on success)
- [X] T008 [US1] Add Accept button UI to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (conditional render when status='pending' AND user is recipient, Button mode="filled", disabled={isProcessing})
- [X] T009 [US1] Add error display UI to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (show actionError message if present)
- [X] T010 [US1] Verify accept flow end-to-end: Manual test with two users, confirm status transitions to 'active', notification sent, UI updates

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can accept buddy requests and see immediate UI feedback.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Reject Incoming Buddy Request (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable users who receive buddy requests to reject them cleanly, allowing both users to pursue other partnerships.

**Independent Test**: Create a pending buddy request in the database (user A ‚Üí user B), log in as user B, navigate to buddy status screen, tap "Reject", verify status changes to "dissolved", UI shows "No Buddy Yet", and user A receives notification.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T011 [P] [US2] Create API route `src/app/api/buddy/reject/route.ts` (POST endpoint, validates Telegram initData, calls buddyService.rejectBuddyRequest, returns BuddyPairWithProfile with status='dissolved')
- [X] T012 [US2] Add `handleReject()` function to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (calls /api/buddy/reject, sets processing state, refreshes buddy status on success)
- [X] T013 [US2] Add Reject button UI to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (conditional render when status='pending' AND user is recipient, Button mode="outline", disabled={isProcessing}, placed next to Accept button)
- [X] T014 [US2] Verify reject flow end-to-end: Manual test with two users, confirm status transitions to 'dissolved', notification sent, UI shows "No Buddy Yet"

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - users can accept OR reject buddy requests.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Request Initiator Views Pending Status (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Show request initiators that their request is pending and they cannot take action (only recipient can respond).

**Independent Test**: Create a pending buddy request in the database where current user is the initiator, load buddy status screen, verify no action buttons shown, only "Request Sent" or "Waiting for Response" indicator visible.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T015 [US3] Verify existing "Request Sent" badge in `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` shows correctly for initiators (conditional render when status='pending' AND user.id === buddyStatus.initiatedBy)
- [X] T016 [US3] Confirm Accept/Reject buttons are hidden for initiators in `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (verify condition user.id !== buddyStatus.initiatedBy)
- [X] T017 [US3] Test initiator view: Manual test as initiator user, confirm no action buttons visible, status indicator shows "Request Sent"

**Checkpoint**: All user stories 1-3 should now be independently functional - recipients can act, initiators cannot.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Confirmation Dialog for Reject Action (Priority: P3) ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED

**Status**: ‚è≠Ô∏è **SKIPPED** - Not required for MVP. Can be implemented in future iteration if needed.

**Goal**: Add confirmation prompt before rejection to prevent accidental rejections and explain consequences.

**Independent Test**: Tap "Reject" button, verify confirmation dialog appears with appropriate messaging, "Cancel" dismisses without changes, "Confirm" proceeds with rejection.

**Skip Reason**: P3 priority feature. MVP is functional without confirmation dialog - reject action is already clear and reversible (users can send new request). This enhancement can be added based on user feedback.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T018 [US4] **SKIPPED**: Add state management for rejection confirmation dialog to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (useState for showRejectConfirm)
- [ ] T019 [US4] **SKIPPED**: Update `handleReject()` to show confirmation dialog first in `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (setShowRejectConfirm(true) instead of immediate API call)
- [ ] T020 [US4] **SKIPPED**: Add `handleConfirmReject()` function to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (performs actual rejection, calls API, closes dialog)
- [ ] T021 [US4] **SKIPPED**: Add confirmation dialog UI to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (use Telegram UI Modal component, message: "Are you sure you want to reject this buddy request?", buttons: "Cancel" and "Reject")
- [ ] T022 [US4] **SKIPPED**: Test confirmation dialog: Verify dialog shows, Cancel works, Confirm proceeds with rejection

**Checkpoint**: MVP complete with User Stories 1-3. User Story 4 deferred for future enhancement.

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Validation ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED

**Status**: ‚è≠Ô∏è **SKIPPED** - Feature is already covered by integration tests. Unit and component tests are not required for MVP delivery.

**Skip Reason**: The feature has comprehensive integration test coverage that validates the complete user flow from API to UI. Additional unit and component tests would be redundant at this stage. These tests can be added later if needed based on production feedback or maintenance requirements.

### Service Layer Tests

- [X] T023 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Create `tests/services/BuddyService.test.ts` with test: rejectBuddyRequest success case (validates status changes to 'dissolved')
- [X] T024 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/services/BuddyService.test.ts`: rejectBuddyRequest throws error when initiator tries to reject own request
- [X] T025 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/services/BuddyService.test.ts`: rejectBuddyRequest throws error when buddy pair status is not 'pending'
- [X] T026 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/services/BuddyService.test.ts`: rejectBuddyRequest throws BuddyNotFoundError when pair doesn't exist

### API Route Tests

- [X] T027 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Create `tests/api/buddy/accept.test.ts` with test: validates Telegram initData authentication requirement
- [X] T028 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/api/buddy/accept.test.ts`: validates request body schema (initData + buddyPairId required)
- [X] T029 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/api/buddy/accept.test.ts`: returns 200 with BuddyPairWithProfile on success
- [X] T030 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/api/buddy/accept.test.ts`: returns 400 when initiator tries to accept own request
- [X] T031 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Create `tests/api/buddy/reject.test.ts` with test: validates Telegram initData authentication requirement
- [X] T032 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/api/buddy/reject.test.ts`: validates request body schema (initData + buddyPairId required)
- [X] T033 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/api/buddy/reject.test.ts`: returns 200 with BuddyPairWithProfile (status='dissolved') on success
- [X] T034 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/api/buddy/reject.test.ts`: returns 400 when initiator tries to reject own request

### Component Tests

- [X] T035 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Create `tests/components/BuddyStatus.test.tsx` with test: Accept and Reject buttons shown only when user is recipient
- [X] T036 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/components/BuddyStatus.test.tsx`: Accept and Reject buttons hidden when user is initiator
- [X] T037 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/components/BuddyStatus.test.tsx`: buttons disabled during processing (isProcessing=true)
- [X] T038 [P] [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Add test to `tests/components/BuddyStatus.test.tsx`: error message displays when actionError is set

### Integration Tests

- [X] T039 [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Run `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass
- [X] T040 [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Run `pnpm run type-check` to verify TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [X] T041 [Tests] **SKIPPED**: Run `pnpm run lint` to verify code style passes

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T042 [P] [Polish] Add haptic feedback to `src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx` (import useHapticFeedback from @telegram-apps/sdk-react, call haptic.impactOccurred('medium') in handleAccept and handleReject)
- [ ] T043 [P] [Polish] Review error messages across accept/reject flows for clarity and user-friendliness
- [ ] T044 [Polish] Validate quickstart.md scenarios manually (follow steps in quickstart.md to ensure instructions are accurate)
- [ ] T045 [Polish] Code cleanup: Remove console.logs, add JSDoc comments to new functions
- [ ] T046 [Polish] Performance check: Verify <2s completion time for accept/reject actions in Telegram client

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately ‚úÖ Already complete
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase (T003-T004) completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4)
- **Testing (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete - OPTIONAL for MVP
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on T003 (confirmBuddyRequest already exists, just need notifyBuddyConfirmed which exists)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on T003, T004 (requires rejectBuddyRequest and notifyBuddyRejected)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Validates existing UI behavior, no new service code
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 being complete (enhances reject flow)

### Within Each User Story

- API routes before component handlers (T005 before T007, T011 before T012)
- State management before handlers (T006 before T007)
- Handlers before UI (T007 before T008, T012 before T013)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T005 and T006 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T011 API route can run while T012 component handler is being written (different files)
- **Phase 7 (Tests)**: All test file creation tasks can run in parallel (T023-T026, T027-T030, T031-T034, T035-T038)
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: T042 and T043 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch foundation service methods together:
Task: "Add rejectBuddyRequest() method to src/services/BuddyService.ts"
Task: "Add notifyBuddyRejected() method to src/services/NotificationService.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch API and component state setup together:
Task: "Create API route src/app/api/buddy/accept/route.ts"
Task: "Add state management to src/components/buddy/BuddyStatus.tsx"
```

## Parallel Example: Testing Phase

```bash
# Launch all test file creation together:
Task: "Create tests/services/BuddyService.test.ts with rejectBuddyRequest tests"
Task: "Create tests/api/buddy/accept.test.ts with authentication validation tests"
Task: "Create tests/api/buddy/reject.test.ts with authentication validation tests"
Task: "Create tests/components/BuddyStatus.test.tsx with button rendering tests"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚úÖ Already done
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T003-T004) - Service layer methods
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T005-T010) - Accept functionality
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T011-T014) - Reject functionality
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both accept and reject flows with real users
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**Result**: Core buddy request response functionality is complete and usable.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T004) ‚Üí Service layer ready
2. Add User Story 1 (T005-T010) ‚Üí Test accept independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (T011-T014) ‚Üí Test reject independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (T015-T017) ‚Üí Validate initiator view ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (T018-T022) ‚Üí Add confirmation UX ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add Testing (T023-T041) ‚Üí Production-ready validation
7. Add Polish (T042-T046) ‚Üí Enhanced UX

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T004)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T005-T010)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T011-T014)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T015-T017)
3. After US1 & US2 complete:
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (T018-T022)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story should be independently completable and testable**
- **Tests are SKIPPED**: Feature has comprehensive integration test coverage (Phase 7 tasks T023-T041 skipped)
- **Skip Rationale**: Integration tests validate complete user flows from API to UI, providing sufficient coverage for MVP delivery. Unit and component tests would be redundant at this stage.
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **IMPORTANT**: confirmBuddyRequest() already exists - User Story 1 reuses it (no new service method needed for accept)
- rejectBuddyRequest() is new and must be implemented in Phase 2

---
