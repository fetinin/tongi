# Specification Quality Checklist: Buddy Request Accept/Reject Actions

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASS

- Specification focuses on what users need (accept/reject buddy requests) without mentioning React, TypeScript, Next.js, or specific component implementations
- Clearly explains business value: enabling the buddy system to function properly
- Written in plain language understandable by product managers or stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASS

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all aspects are well-defined
- Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-012) is specific and testable
  - Example: "FR-001: System MUST display 'Accept' and 'Reject' action buttons... only when the current user is the recipient" - clearly testable
- Success criteria include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "under 5 seconds" - measurable time
  - SC-003: "99% of the time" - measurable success rate
  - SC-005: "Zero duplicate buddy pair records" - measurable count
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of React state, API routes, database queries)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format consistently
- Edge cases identified: race conditions, deleted accounts, network failures, duplicate submissions
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions about authentication, notifications, UI framework, etc.

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASS

- Each of 12 functional requirements mapped to user scenarios
- User stories cover all primary flows:
  - P1: Accept request (happy path for recipients)
  - P1: Reject request (equally critical for user agency)
  - P2: Initiator view (UX clarity)
  - P3: Confirmation dialog (quality of life)
- Measurable outcomes defined for task completion time (SC-001, SC-002), reliability (SC-003), user comprehension (SC-004), data integrity (SC-005), notification delivery (SC-006), and error handling (SC-007)
- No implementation leakage - specification remains at the business/user level

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

The spec successfully:
- Identifies the core user need (responding to buddy requests)
- Breaks down into independently testable user stories with clear priorities
- Defines measurable success criteria without technical implementation details
- Addresses edge cases and error scenarios
- Documents assumptions and out-of-scope items for clarity
