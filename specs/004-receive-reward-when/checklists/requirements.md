## Validation Summary

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-16
**Validation Result**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

### Clarifications Resolved

1. **Bank Wallet Key Compromise Handling** (Q1) - Resolved with Option A: Manual incident response procedure (out of system scope); no automated key rotation included

### Key Strengths

- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P4) with independent testability
- Comprehensive edge case coverage including blockchain-specific scenarios
- Technology-agnostic success criteria that focus on system behavior not blockchain timing
- Complete security considerations with realistic scope boundaries
- Well-defined out-of-scope items preventing scope creep

### Ready for Next Phase

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning.
